Hangfire.Firebird
===================
This is an plugin to the Hangfire to enable Firebird as a storage system.
Read about hangfire here: https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire#hangfire-
and here: http://hangfire.io/

Instructions
------------
Install Hangfire, see https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire#installation

Download all files from this repository, add the Hangfire.Firebird.csproj to your solution.
Reference it in your project, and you are ready to go by using:

```csharp
app.UseHangfire(config =>
{
    config.UseFirebirdStorage("<connection string or its name>");
    config.UseServer();
});
```

Using Firebird with MSMQ
------------------------

To use MSMQ queues, you should do the following steps:

1. **Create them manually on each host**. Don't forget to grant appropriate permissions.
2. Register all MSMQ queues in current ``FirebirdStorage`` instance.

If you are using only default queue, pass the path pattern to the ``UseMsmqQueues`` extension method (it also applicable to the :doc:`OWIN bootstrapper <owin-bootstrapper>`):

```csharp
app.UseHangfire(config =>
{
   config.UseFirebirdStorage("<connection string or its name>")
         .UseMsmqQueues(@".\hangfire-{0}");
});
```
